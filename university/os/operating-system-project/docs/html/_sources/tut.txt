Introduction
=======================

Developing OS is complex task that requires very specific development environment and 
set of tools. Theoretically one could write an OS in any language he wants, however assembly, 
C and C++ are de facto languages for this kind of job.

Our compiler suite of choice is GCC, build system cmake, and scripting language Bash. 
Everything is build and assembled inside virtual machine built by vagrant. Vagrant 
enables us to automate complete complex process of building cross compiler, OS, linking 
and producing iso (even building documentation) into a single ``vagrant up`` command.

All development and examples were ran on Debian 9. Feel free to work from vagrant machine 
if you don't want to bother with setting up everything on your own host OS.

Development environment
=======================
Since we will be building and installing a lot of tools frequently many things could go wrong.
To make our life easier we can use virtual machines, and to make everything even more hassle free,
we can utilize virtual machine manager, such as vagrant. 

Preparing the box
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Installing virtualbox and vagrant on Debian 9 is rather straightforward:

.. code:: bash

    # add stretch-backports main and contrib to your apt sources
    sudo apt install virtualbox
    wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/2.1.1/vagrant_2.1.1_x86_64.deb
    sudo dpkg -i vagrant_2.1.1_x86_64.deb

Once we have the software we can write small vagrant script:

.. code:: ruby

  # -*- mode: ruby -*-
  # vi: set ft=ruby :
  Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
    config.vm.box = "generic/debian9"
    config.vm.box_check_update = false
    config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/home/src"
    config.vm.provision :shell, path: "bootstrap.sh"
  end

Save it as Vagrantfile in the root of the project. This particular vagrant file downloads
Debian 9 image, mounts its root directory under ``/home/src`` in the virtual machine and
executes ``bootstrap.sh``. Shell script then invokes ``i686-elf-tools.sh`` script that 
downloads necessary sources and compiles cross compiler. Once the compiler is built 
bootstrap script invokes cmake that builds the OS itself, bootable iso and 
documentation.

Finally, starting whole building process is as simple as executing ``vargant up`` in the 
projects root directory.

Cross Compiler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An cross-compiler is a compiler that runs on platform A (the host), but generates executables for platform B (the target). 
These two platforms may (but do not need to) differ in CPU, operating system, and/or executable format. In our case, 
the host platform is our current operating system, and the target platform is the operating system we are building.

.. image:: cross-compiler.png

GCC is great open source compiler and we will use it as cross compiler for our OS. The GNU Compiler Collection is an advanced piece of software with many dependencies. We will also need Binutils which are collection of binary tools, since we are also interested in linker and assembler.

Cross compiler building process is rather complex and lengthy process. See i686-elf-tools.sh for details.


First steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Small assembly code to demonstrate building bootable iso image.

.. code-block:: nasm

    global loader                   ; the entry symbol for ELF

    MAGIC_NUMBER equ 0x1BADB002     ; define the magic number constant
    FLAGS        equ 0x0            ; multiboot flags
    CHECKSUM     equ -MAGIC_NUMBER  ; calculate the checksum
                                    ; (magic number + checksum + flags should equal 0)

    section .text:                  ; start of the text (code) section
    align 4                         ; the code must be 4 byte aligned
        dd MAGIC_NUMBER             ; write the magic number to the machine code,
        dd FLAGS                    ; the flags,
        dd CHECKSUM                 ; and the checksum

    loader:                         ; the loader label (defined as entry point in linker script)
        mov eax, 0xCAFEBABE         ; place the number 0xCAFEBABE in the register eax
    .loop:
        jmp .loop                   ; loop forever

The file loader.s can be compiled into a 32 bits ELF [18] object file with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    nasm -f elf32 loader.s

The code must now be linked to produce an executable file, which requires some extra thought 
compared to when linking most programs. We want GRUB to load the kernel at a memory address 
larger than or equal to 0x00100000 (1 megabyte (MB)), because addresses lower than 1 MB are 
used by GRUB itself, BIOS and memory-mapped I/O. Therefore, the following linker script is 
needed (written for GNU LD):

.. code::

  ENTRY(loader)                /* the name of the entry label */
  
  SECTIONS {
      . = 0x00100000;          /* the code should be loaded at 1 MB */
  
      .text ALIGN (0x1000) :   /* align at 4 KB */
      {
          *(.text)             /* all text sections from all files */
      }
  
      .rodata ALIGN (0x1000) : /* align at 4 KB */
      {
          *(.rodata*)          /* all read-only data sections from all files */
      }
  
      .data ALIGN (0x1000) :   /* align at 4 KB */
      {
          *(.data)             /* all data sections from all files */
      }
  
      .bss ALIGN (0x1000) :    /* align at 4 KB */
      {
          *(COMMON)            /* all COMMON sections from all files */
          *(.bss)              /* all bss sections from all files */
      }
  }


Save the linker script into a file called link.ld. The executable can now be linked with 
the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    ld -T link.ld -melf_i386 loader.o -o kernel.elf

If you have GRUB installed, you can check whether a file has a valid Multiboot version 1 header, 
which is the case for our kernel. It's important that the Multiboot header is within the first 
8 KiB of the actual program file at 4 byte alignment. This can potentially break later if you 
make a mistake in the boot assembly, the linker script, or anything else that might go wrong. 
If the header isn't valid, GRUB will give an error that it can't find a Multiboot header when 
you try to boot it. This code fragment will help you diagnose such cases: 

.. code:: bash

  grub-file --is-x86-multiboot kernel.elf

Grub-file is quiet but will exit 0 (successfully) if it is a valid multiboot kernel and exit 1
(unsuccessfully) otherwise. You can type ``echo $?`` in your shell immediately afterwards to see 
the exit status. 

Building ISO 
~~~~~~~~~~~~
We will create the kernel ISO image with the program grub-mkrescue. A folder must first be created 
that contains the files that will be on the ISO image. The following commands create the folder and 
copy the files to their correct places:

.. code:: bash

    mkdir -p iso/boot/grub              # create the folder structure
    cp kernel.bin iso/boot/             # copy the kernel


A `configuration file <https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/legacy/Configuration.html#Configuration>`_ menu.cfg 
for GRUB must be created. This file tells GRUB where the kernel is located and configures some options:

.. code::

  set timeout=30
  set default=0
  menuentry "KaT OS" {
      multiboot /boot/kernel.bin
      boot
  }


Place the file in the folder iso/boot/grub/. The contents of the iso folder should now look like the 
following figure:

.. code::

 iso
 └── boot
     ├── grub
     │   └── grub.cfg
     └── kernel.bin

Finally, make a ISO9660 image file by invoking: 

.. code:: bash

    grub-mkrescue -o os.iso iso

This produces a file named os.iso, which then can be burned into a CD (or a DVD) or loaded directly 
into virtual machine. The ISO image contains the kernel executable, the GRUB bootloader and the 
configuration file.

To run the OS in QEMU emulator execute:

.. code:: bash

    qemu-system-i386 -cdrom os.iso 

.. image:: grub.png

Operating system basics
=======================
The job of an operating system is to share a computer among multiple 
programs and to provide a more useful set of services than the hardware 
alone supports. The operating system manages and abstracts the low-level 
hardware, so that, for example, a word processor need not concern itself 
with which type of disk hardware is being used. It also shares the hardware 
among multiple programs so that they run (or appear to run) at the same 
time. Finally, operating systems provide controlled ways for programs to 
interact, so that they can share data or work together. 

x86 is a family of backward-compatible instruction set architectures based on 
the Intel 8086 CPU and its Intel 8088 variant. The 8086 was introduced in 1978 
as a fully 16-bit extension of Intel's 8-bit-based 8080 microprocessor, with memory 
segmentation as a solution for addressing more memory than can be covered by a plain 
16-bit address. The term "x86" came into being because the names of several successors 
to Intel's 8086 processor end in "86", including the 80186, 80286, 80386 and 80486 processors. [1]


Booting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you turn on a computer, it loads the BIOS from some special flash 
memory. The BIOS runs self test and initialization routines of the hardware, 
then it looks for bootable devices. If it finds one, the control is 
transferred to its bootloader, which is a small portion of executable 
code stored at the device's beginning. The bootloader has to determine 
the location of the kernel image on the device and load it into memory. 
It also needs to switch the CPU to the so-called protected mode because 
x86 CPUs start in the very limited real mode by default (to be backwards 
compatible).

.. image:: boot-process.png

We won't write a bootloader because that would be a complex project on its 
own. Fortunately there is a bootloader standard: the Multiboot Specification. 
Our kernel just needs to indicate that it supports Multiboot and every 
Multiboot-compliant bootloader can boot it. We will use the Multiboot 2 
specification  together with the well-known GRUB 2 bootloader.

To indicate our Multiboot 2 support to the bootloader, our kernel must start 
with a Multiboot Header, which has the following format:

+----------------+------------------+-----------------------------------------+
|     Field      |      Type        |                  Value                  |
+================+==================+=========================================+
| magic number   | u32              | 0xE85250D6                              |
+----------------+------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| architecture   | u32              | 0 for i386, 4 for MIPS                  |
+----------------+------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| header length  | u32              | total header size, including tags       |
+----------------+------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| checksum       | u32              | -(magic + architecture + header_length) |
+----------------+------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| tags           | variable         |                                         |
+----------------+------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| end tag        | (u16, u16, u32)  | (0, 0, 8)                               |
+----------------+------------------+-----------------------------------------+

We can define the constants and header in assembly:

.. code:: gas

  # multiboot header constants 
  .set ALIGN,    1<<0             # align loaded modules on page boundaries
  .set MEMINFO,  1<<1             # provide memory map
  .set FLAGS,    ALIGN | MEMINFO  # this is the Multiboot 'flag' field
  .set MAGIC,    0x1BADB002       # 'magic number' lets bootloader find the header
  .set CHECKSUM, -(MAGIC + FLAGS) # checksum of above, to prove we are multiboot

  # Declare a header as in the Multiboot Standard.
  .section .multiboot
  .align 4
  .long MAGIC
  .long FLAGS
  .long CHECKSUM

We put header into special section so we can force it to 
be in the start of the final program. The bootloader will 
search for this magic sequence and recognize us as a multiboot kernel.

Grub moves kernel into protected mode that allows system software to use 
features such as  virtual memory, paging and safe multi-tasking designed to 
increase an operating system's control over application software.


Device drivers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A device driver is a specific type of computer software developed to allow interaction 
with hardware devices. Typically this constitutes an interface for communicating with 
the device, through the specific computer bus or communications subsystem that the 
hardware is connected to, providing commands to and/or receiving data from the device, 
and on the other end, the requisite interfaces to the operating system and software 
applications. It is a specialized hardware-dependent computer program which is also 
operating system specific that enables another program, typically an operating system or 
applications software package or computer program running under the operating system kernel, 
to interact transparently with a hardware device, and usually provides the requisite 
interrupt handling necessary for any necessary asynchronous time-dependent hardware 
interfacing needs.

The screen
----------------
Our kernel gets booted by GRUB in text mode. That is, it has available to it a framebuffer 
(area of memory) that controls a screen of characters (not pixels) 80 wide by 25 high. 
The area of memory known as the framebuffer is accessible just like normal RAM, at address 0xB8000. 
It is important to note, however, that it is not actually normal RAM. It is part of the VGA 
controller's dedicated video memory that has been memory-mapped via hardware into our linear 
address space. The framebuffer is just an array of 16-bit words, each 16-bit value representing 
the display of one character. Highest 8 bits are ASCII value of the character, bits 7-4 represent 
the background and bits 3-0 foreground color.

::

    Bit:     |15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8|7 6 5 4|3 2 1 0|
    Content: | ASCII               | FG    | BG    |

The offset from the start of the framebuffer of the word that specifies a character at position x, y 
is simply ``(y * 80 + x) * 2``.
Say we want to write 'A'(65,or 0x41) with green foreground and dark grey background(8) at place (0,0) 
we would write assembly code ``mov [0x000B8000], 0x4128`` where ``0x41`` represents ASCII A, 2 is green 
and 8 is dark grey color. Second cell (0,1) would be 0x000B8000 + 16 = 0x000B8010.

Reference table of available colors:

 ======== ======== ============= ======== ============== ======== ================ ======= 
  Color    Value      Color       Value       Color       Value        Color        Value  
 ======== ======== ============= ======== ============== ======== ================ ======= 
  Black        0    Red               4    Dark grey          8    Light red           12  
  Blue         1    Magenta           5    Light blue         9    Light magenta       13  
  Green        2    Brown             6    Light green       10    Light brown         14  
  Cyan         3    Light grey        7    Light cyan        11    White               15  
 ======== ======== ============= ======== ============== ======== ================ ======= 

The VGA controller also has some ports on the main I/O bus, which we can use to send it specific instructions. 
(Among others) it has a control register at 0x3D4 and a data register at 0x3D5. We will use these to instruct 
the controller to update it's cursor position.

GDT
------------------------
The Global Descriptor Table (GDT) is a data structure used by 
Intel x86-family processors starting with the 80286 in order to 
define the characteristics of the various memory areas used 
during program execution, including the base address, the size, 
and access privileges like executability and writability. These 
memory areas are called segments in Intel terminology.

The GDT can hold things other than segment descriptors as well. 
Every 8-byte entry in the GDT is a descriptor, but these can also 
be Task State Segment (TSS) descriptors, Local Descriptor Table 
(LDT) descriptors, or Call Gate descriptors. 

The x86 architecture has two methods of memory protection and of 
providing virtual memory - segmentation and paging. 

With segmentation, every memory access is evaluated with respect 
to a segment. That is, the memory address is added to the segment's 
base address, and checked against the segment's length. With paging, 
the address space is split into (usually 4KB, but this can change) 
blocks, called pages. Each page can be mapped into physical 
memory - mapped onto what is called a 'frame'. Or, it can be unmapped.
This way one can create virtual memory spaces. 

Both of these methods have their advantages, but paging is much better. 
Segmentation is, although still usable, fast becoming obsolete as a 
method of memory protection and virtual memory. In fact, the x86-64 
architecture requires a flat memory model (one segment with a 
base of 0 and a limit of 0xFFFFFFFF) for some of it's instructions 
to operate properly. 

Segmentation is, however, completely in-built into the x86 architecture. 
Every memory access which a program can perform always goes through a segment. 
It's impossible to get around it, therefore we need to setup Global Descriptor 
Table - a list of segment descriptors. 

While GRUB does setup GDT for us we don't know where it is nor what is in it. 
In the x86, there are 6 segmentation registers. Each holds an offset into the GDT. 
They are cs (code segment), ds (data segment), es (extra segment), fs, gs, ss (stack segment). 
The code segment must reference a descriptor which is set as a 'code segment'. 
There is a flag for this in the access byte. The rest should all reference a descriptor 
which is set as a 'data segment'. 

To set up GDT we need to create GDT entry structure and a special pointer structure
which we give to the processor so it can find the GDT.

Interrupts
------------------------
In system programming, an interrupt is a signal to the processor emitted 
by hardware or software indicating an event that needs immediate attention. 
An interrupt alerts the processor to a high-priority condition requiring 
the interruption of the current code the processor is executing. 
The processor responds by suspending its current activities, saving its 
state, and executing a function called an interrupt handler (or an interrupt 
service routine, ISR) to deal with the event. This interruption is temporary, 
and, after the interrupt handler finishes, the processor resumes normal 
activities. 

There are 2 types of interrupts plus Exceptions:

  - Hardware interrupts: are sent to the processor from an external device (keyboard, mouse, hard disk, ...). Hardware interrupts were introduced as a way to reduce wasting the processor's valuable time in polling loops, waiting for external events.
  - Software interrupts: are initiated voluntarily by the software. It's used to manage system calls.
  - Exceptions are used for errors or events occurring during program execution that are exceptional enough that they cannot be handled within the program itself (division by zero, page fault, ...)

The PIC (Programmable interrupt controller)is a device that is used to 
combine several sources of interrupt onto one or more CPU lines, while 
allowing priority levels to be assigned to its interrupt outputs. When the 
device has multiple interrupt outputs to assert, it asserts them in the 
order of their relative priority.

The Interrupt Descriptor Table tells the processor where to find handlers 
for each interrupt. It is very similar to the GDT. It is just an array of 
entries, each one corresponding to an interrupt number. There are 256 
possible interrupt numbers, so 256 must be defined. If an interrupt occurs 
and there is no entry for it (even a NULL entry is fine), the processor 
will panic and reset. The processor will sometimes needs to signal the kernel. 
Something major may have happened, such as a divide-by-zero, or a page fault. 
To do this, it uses the first 32 interrupts. It is therefore doubly 
important that all of these are mapped and non-NULL - else the CPU will 
triple-fault and reset.

Like the GDT, the IDT is loaded using the LIDTL assembly instruction. 
It expects the location of a IDT description structure (pointer).

We define our IDT table and then load it using LIDTL. The IDT table can be 
stored wherever we want in memory, its address should just be signaled to 
the process using the IDTR registry. After intialization of our IDT, we 
can activate interrupts by configuring the PIC.

PS/2 Keyboard
--------------
The PS/2 Keyboard is a device that talks to a PS/2 controller using serial communication. 
Ideally, each different type of PS/2 controller driver should provide some sort of 
standard/simple "send byte/receive byte" interface, and the PS/2 Keyboard driver would 
use this interface without caring about lower level details (like what type of PS/2 controller 
the device is plugged into).

The PS/2 Keyboard accepts commands and sends responses to those commands, and also sends scan 
codes indicating when a key was pressed or released. A command is one byte. Some commands have 
data byte/s which must be sent after the command byte. The keyboard typically responds to a 
command by sending either an "ACK" (to acknowledge the command) or a "Resend" (to say something 
was wrong with the previous command) back.


Memory management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Virtual memory is an abstraction of physical memory. 
The purpose of virtual memory is generally to simplify application 
development and to let processes address more memory than what is 
actually physically present in the machine. We also don’t want 
applications messing with the kernel or other applications’ memory due 
to security.

In the x86 architecture, virtual memory can be accomplished in two ways: 
segmentation and paging. Paging is by far the most common and versatile 
technique, and we’ll implement it the next chapter. Some use of segmentation 
is still necessary to allow for code to execute under different privilege 
levels.

Segmentation
--------------
Segmentation in x86 means accessing the memory through segments. 
Segments are portions of the address space, possibly overlapping, 
specified by a base address and a limit. To address a byte in segmented 
memory you use a 48-bit logical address: 16 bits that specifies the 
segment and 32-bits that specifies what offset within that segment you want. 
The offset is added to the base address of the segment, and the resulting linear 
address is checked against the segment’s limit. If everything 
works out fine the result is a linear address. 
When paging is disabled, then the linear address space is mapped 1:1 onto the physical 
address space, and the physical memory can be accessed.
We enable segmentation via GDT.

Paging
--------------
Segmentation translates a logical address into a linear address. 
Paging translates these linear addresses onto the physical address space, 
and determines access rights and how the memory should be cached.

Paging in x86 consists of a page directory (PDT) that can contain 
references to 1024 page tables (PT), each of which can point to 
1024 sections of physical memory called page frames (PF). Each page 
frame is 4096 byte large. In a virtual (linear) address, the highest 
10 bits specifies the offset of a page directory entry (PDE) in the 
current PDT, the next 10 bits the offset of a page table entry (PTE) 
within the page table pointed to by that PDE. The lowest 12 bits in the 
address is the offset within the page frame to be addressed.

All page directories, page tables and page frames need to be aligned 
on 4096 byte addresses. This makes it possible to address a PDT, PT or 
PF with just the highest 20 bits of a 32 bit address, since the lowest 
12 need to be zero.

The PDE and PTE structure is very similar to each other: 32 bits (4 bytes), 
where the highest 20 bits points to a PTE or PF, and the lowest 12 bits 
control access rights and other configurations. 4 bytes times 1024 equals 
4096 bytes, so a page directory and page table both fit in a page frame 
themselves.

The simplest kind of paging is when we map each virtual address onto the 
same physical address, called identity paging. This can be done at compile 
time by creating a page directory where each entry points to its 
corresponding 4 MB frame.


Page Frame Allocation
----------------------
Role of page frame allocator is simply to tell the OS which parts of memory
are free to use. We need to know how much memory is available on the 
computer the OS is running on. We can read it from the multiboot structure 
passed to us by GRUB. GRUB collects the information we need about the 
memory - what is reserved, I/O mapped, read-only etc.


Processes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Creating new processes is usually done with two different system calls: 
fork and exec. fork creates an exact copy of the currently running process, 
while exec replaces the current process with one that is specified by a path 
to the location of a program in the file system. 



System calls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
System calls is the way user-mode applications interact with the kernel - 
to ask for resources, request operations to be performed, etc. 

System calls are traditionally invoked with software interrupts. The 
user applications put the appropriate values in registers or on the stack 
and then initiates a pre-defined interrupt which transfers execution to the 
kernel.

When system calls are executed, the current privilege level is typically 
changed from PL3 to PL0 (if the application is running in user mode). 
To allow this, the DPL of the entry in the IDT for the system call interrupt 
needs to allow PL3 access.

To enable system calls we need to setup a TSS before entering user mode.

File system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The purpose of file system is to organise and store data. File system
typically supports sharing data among users and applications, as well as
persistence so data is still available after reboot.

The communication between computer and optical drive can be done by various 
types of controllers and cabling such as ATAPI, SATA, or USB. Many operating 
systems offer some kind of generic SCSI driver interface which abtracts the 
various transports to a single transaction API. These APIs are also available 
in userspace. 

KaT OS implements ISO 9660 file system and ATA/ATAPI drivers.


PCI IDE Controller
-------------------

DE is a keyword which refers to the electrical specification of the cables which 
connect ATA drives (like hard drives) to another device. The drives use the 
ATA (Advanced Technology Attachment) interface. An IDE cable also can terminate 
at an IDE card connected to PCI.

Parallel ATA (PATA), originally AT Attachment, is an interface standard for 
the connection of storage devices such as hard disk drives, floppy disk drives, 
and optical disc drives in computers. It uses the underlying AT Attachment (ATA) 
and AT Attachment Packet Interface (ATAPI) standards.

ATAPI is an extension to ATA (recently renamed to PATA) and Serial ATA, which adds 
support for the SCSI command set. With ATAPI a greater variety of devices can be 
connected to a computer than with ATA alone. 

ATAPI devices are also "speaking ATA" because the ATA physical interface and protocol 
are still being used to send the packets. On the other hand, ATA hard drives and solid 
state drives do not use ATAPI. ATAPI is basically a way to issue SCSI commands to a CD-ROM, 
CD-RW, DVD, or tape drive, attached to the ATA bus. 

ATAPI uses a very small number of ATA commands. The most important are the PACKET 
command (0xA0), and IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE (0xA1). 

An IDE driver does not need to know whether a drive is parallel or serial, it only has 
to know whether it's using ATA or ATAPI. IDE can connect up to 4 drives. Each drive can 
be one of the following:

 - ATA (Serial): Used for most modern hard drives.
 - ATA (Parallel): Commonly used for hard drives.
 - ATAPI (Serial): Used for most modern optical drives.
 - ATAPI (Parallel): Commonly used for optical drives. 

ISO 9660
----------------
ISO 9660 is the standard file system for CD-ROMs. It is also widely used 
on DVD and BD media and may as well be present on USB sticks or hard disks. 
Its specifications are available for free under the name ECMA-119. 

An ISO 9660 sector is normally 2 KiB long. Although the specification allows 
for alternative sector sizes, you will rarely find anything other than 2 KiB. 
ISO 9660 file systems can have up to 2 exp 32 blocks, i.e. 8 TiB.

The following is the rough overall structure of the ISO 9660 file system:

+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|              ISO 9660 File System                            |
+=========================+====================================+
| System Area             | Unused by ISO 9660                 |
+-------------------------+------------------------------------+
| Data Area               | Volume Descriptor Set              | 
|                         |                                    |
|                         | Path tables, Directories and Files | 
+-------------------------+------------------------------------+

The ISO 9660 standard specifies three ways to encode 16 and 32-bit integers, 
using either little-endian (least-significant byte first), big-endian 
(most-significant byte first), or a combination of both (little-endian followed
by big-endian). Both-endian (LSB-MSB) fields are therefore twice as wide. 
For this reason, 32-bit LBA's often appear as 8 byte fields. Where a both-endian 
format is present, the x86 architecture makes use of the first little-endian 
sequence and ignores the big-endian sequence. 

The virtual filesystem
----------------------
A VFS is intended to abstract away details of the filesystem and location 
that files are stored, and to give access to them in a uniform manner. 
They are usually implemented as a graph of nodes; Each node representing 
either a file, directory, symbolic link, device, socket or pipe. Each node 
should know what filesystem it belongs to and have enough information such 
that the relevant open/close/etc functions in its driver can be found and 
executed. A common way to accomplish this is to have the node store function 
pointers which can be called by the kernel. We need a few function pointers: 

 - Open - Called when a node is opened as a file descriptor.
 - Close - Called when the node is closed.
 - Read & Write
 - Readdir
 - Finddir

Mountpoints are the UNIX way of accessing different file systems. 
A filesystem is mounted on a directory - any subsequent access to that 
directory will actually access the root directory of the new filesystem. 
So essentially the directory is told that it is a mountpoint and given a 
pointer to the root node of the new filesystem.
