x86 Assembly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    Lets make some test files
    > nano test.asm
    > nasm -f bin test.asm -o test  (apt-get nasm) 
       -f specifies the file format of the output file(-o)
       in this case its bin(flat binary output without any extra information,
       as in assembly code -> machine code(as is, without overhead of metadata) 
    
	Note: using bin format puts nasm by default into 16-bit mode, to enable 32bit
          add "bits 32" at beginning of an nasm source file

    we can examine the output using hd(HexDump) 
    > hd test
    00000000 66 ff e0            |f..|
    00000003
    We can see that file only consists of 3 bytes : 66 ff e0, which is equivalent 
    to the instruction jmp eax


    In next few examples im using 'a' as (labeled memory address)/(register)
    mov a,0x1    ;Move hex '1' to 'a'
    mov a,[0x1]  ;Move value on location '0x1' to 'a'

| calc |
+------+

::

    add a   ;a=a+0x1 | (a=a+1)
    add a,b ;a=a+b

    sub a,b ;a=a-b

    ;To multiply we need to use eax
    mov eax,5  ; eax = 5 (eax is acc used by multiplication)
    imul eax,2 ; eax = eax*2
    ;imul Performs singed multiply, we can also use mul to perform unsigned mult.

    ; Divsion
    mov eax, 5       ;eax = 5
    cdq              ;?
    idiv 2           ;Perform division,store result in 'eax' and store reminder in 'edx'
    mov result,eax   ;result = edx  -> result==2
    mov reminder,edx ;reminder=edx -> reminder == 1

    So basicly from Division we can get '/' and '%' as result

::

    ; NEG
    mov a,5
    neg a ;a = 0-a , that means a= -a , in this case a==-5 

    ; AND (performes '&', not '&&')
    ;That means if we have 0101 and 0001 ,result would be 0001
    ;Few more examples: 1111 & 1000 == 1000,1111 & 1101 == 1101
    and eax,a

    ; OR
    ; Similar to and , it performs bitwise OR 
    ; 1100 | 0000 == 1100,1010 | 0101 == 1111
    or eax,a

    ; XOR
    ; if 2 bits are diferend resulting bit is 1
    ; 1010 xor 1001 == 0011, 1111 xor 1101 == 1101 
    xor eax,a

| Bit     |
| shifting|
+---------+

::

    ; LEFT (sal,shl -google diferences)
    mov eax,5   ;eax = 5 (eax = 0101***)
    ; ***Of course if it was 16,32,64 bit it would have more 0
    shl eax,0x8 ;eax << 8 , shift eax 8 bits to left

    ; RIGHT (sar,shl -google diferences)
    mov eax,5
    shr eax,0x8 ;eax >> 8, shift eax 8 bits to right


+---------+
|  stack  |
+---------+

::

    > push -> add new element on top of the stack
    > pop -> remove the top-most element from the stack

    x86 uses 'esp' register to point to the top of the stack(the newest element)

GNU Debugger
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  make some test C file(simple hello world)
    ``gdb hello.c``
    (gdb) info target,
    Entry point - First code the program runs,
    example: "Entry point: 0x580"

-  same like "info target" but with more info
    (gdb) ``maint info sections``
    
-  you can also display only few sections
    (gdb) ``maint info sections .text .data .bss``
    
-  displat only sections that contain "CODE"
    (gdb) ``maint info sections CODE``

-  list all function names and their loaded addresses you can use regex to filter also
    (gdb) ``info functions``

-  list all global and static variable names you can use regex also
    (gdb) ``info variables``

-  List current values in commonly used registers
    (gdb) ``info registers``

-  display assembly code of a function
    (gdb) ``disassemble main``

-  display assembly code with source code
    (gdb) ``disassemble /s main``

-  display assembly code with souece code and hex
    (gdb) ``disassemble /rs main``

-  display function in a specific file
    (gdb) ``disassemble /rs 'hello.c'::main``

-  start running the program
    (gdb) ``r``

-  instead of running from start to finish run until line 3
    (gdb) ``b 3``

-  Proceed to the next statement,first line is output produced after executing that line, 2nd line shows where gdb stops currently
    (gdb) ``n``
