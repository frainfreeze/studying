General roadmap:
(I am adding and removing stuff daily, so to leave only essential and most helpfull things.
I am definetly not sorry for "wasting" my time on "bad" courses and books tho.  )
todo: generate stage 1 from detailed roadmap since its more up to date.

stage 1 (software engineering and CS)
-----------------------------------------------------
lvl 0 - entry+basics
Desc:
    You should be comfortable with all the things programmers use on a daily basis. In particular:
        - basic syntax: statements and expressions, comments, variables,  data types, control structures
        - Be able to decompose your code into functions  and understand why it is a good idea to do so
        - data structures and algorithms
        - Know the language's common idioms and paradigms
        - Know the basic guidelines of good coding style
        - Be able to use a debugger

    Additionaly you will learn:
        - imperative, procedural, functional and object oriented programming
        - manual memory management, basic data structures and algorithms
        - Python, C++, SQL, basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, powershell and bash
