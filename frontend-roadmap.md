<h1 align="center">frontend web development roadmap</h1>

- Eliminate distractions, don't keep checking email, switching songs on youtube etc.
- Don't overwork yourself - recognize when you need to take breaks.
- Simplify things as much as you can - take a big project, cut it into thin slices, rearrange the slices to suit your context.
- When you're working through a book, type out the example code and do all the exercises.
- if you build something document it! take notes about what you have learned. [Markdown tutorial](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- Know what your code does and why it does it. Do not commit guesswork into your repository.
- On a bigger projects include a build process, automated tests, a README.md file that clearly explains the project, and practice using meaningful commit messages.
- Use each project to demonstrate that you can deliver an optimized product. Implement tests, use your build process to minimize assets, use a linter, use style guides and naming conventions.

### Generic job description
A front end developer/engineer is in charge of managing complex details about projects that require analyzing design requirements, as well as recommending technical solutions to make projects scalable, maintainable, and efficient. They also debug websites to fix mistakes in the code to make sure they are error-free for network administrators and end users. A front end developer/engineer needs to handle stress well and be a great team player, as they will normally work many hours and in team settings to ensure all hardware and software works properly. Their main tools involve a personal computer, and popular software such as a word processor or notepad, programming language editors, and different browser setups to check website errors across platforms. They may work in an office with other professionals in similar positions, such as software developers or web designers, or they may work from home. They report to the organization's IT manager. Besides analyzing code and debugging applications, they also should have working knowledge of several programming languages and able to adapt to new versions of software. They also should be proficient in using Office applications, and have advanced knowledge in databases and networks. In addition, a bachelor's degree in information technology is needed to become a front end developer/engineer. Additional certifications such as the SUN, IBM, Microsoft, and Oracle developer certifications can provide advantages over other applicants. (Copyright 2018 PayScale.com) 

### Hiring job description
We are looking for a Front-End Web Developer who is motivated to combine the art of design with the art of programming. Responsibilities will include translation of the UI/UX design wireframes to actual code that will produce visual elements of the application. You will work with the UI/UX designer and bridge the gap between graphical design and technical implementation, taking an active role on both sides and defining how the application looks as well as how it works.

### Responsibilities
- Develop new user-facing features
- Build reusable code and libraries for future use
- Ensure the technical feasibility of UI/UX designs
- Optimize application for maximum speed and scalability
- Assure that all user input is validated before submitting to back-end
- Collaborate with other team members and stakeholders

### Skills And Qualifications
- Proficient understanding of web markup, including HTML5, CSS3
- Basic understanding of server-side CSS pre-processing platforms, such as LESS and SASS
- Proficient understanding of client-side scripting and JavaScript frameworks, including jQuery
- Good understanding of {{Depending on the specific case, a developer should have the knowledge of advanced JavaScript libraries and frameworks, such as AngularJS, KnockoutJS, BackboneJS, ReactJS, DurandalJS, VueJS etc.}}
- Good understanding of asynchronous request handling, partial page updates, and AJAX
- Proficient understanding of cross-browser compatibility issues and ways to work around them.
- Proficient understanding of code versioning tools, such as {{Git / Mercurial / SVN}}
- Good understanding of SEO principles and ensuring that application will adhere to them.
- Basic knowledge of image authoring tools, to be able to crop, resize, or perform small adjustments on an image. Familiarity with tools such as as Gimp or Photoshop is a plus.
> Note: A UI/UX designer is expected to deliver finished resources for the developer to incorporate into the app. However, quite often a front-end web developer needs to make some small adjustments. Every front-end developer is expected to have a proficient knowledge of JavaScript, while most front-end developers should know jQuery.
