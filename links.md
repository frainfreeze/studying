## Practice problems
While nested under language category some of the projects/problems are in fact language independent so feel to take a look at all of these links. Furthermore most of the links in other categories will have solutions available in some popular programming language (usually Python, Java, JavaScript or C++). You can use this fact to your advantage and learn how things work in other languages by comparing your solutions with provided ones.


### Language specific

#### Python
* [CheckiO](https://checkio.org/) &mdash; Python programming challenges. Custom "Missions" can be created by members.
* [Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/) &mdash; "Python Challenge is a game in which each level can be solved by a bit of (Python) programming."
* [Intermediate Python Workshop/Projects](http://wiki.openhatch.org/Intermediate_Python_Workshop/Projects) &mdash; Practice solving problems in Python from scratch. These projects will guide you through breaking down the problem into steps and help you check your work along the way. 

#### C
* [IOCCC](http://www.ioccc.org/) &mdash;  "A contest to write the most obscure/obfuscated C program. (Fun to try to understand the previous year's entries, or to submit a new one.)"

* [Underhanded C Contest](http://www.underhanded-c.org/) &mdash;  "contest to turn out code that is malicious, but passes a rigorous inspection, and looks like an honest mistake. (Try to understand previous year's entries, and learn to find similar mistakes in other people's code)"

#### C\++
* [programmr](http://www.programmr.com/zone/cpp) &mdash; C++ Projects, Challenges & Examples 

#### Clojure
* [4Clojure](http://www.4clojure.com/) &mdash; "4Clojure is a resource to help fledgling clojurians learn the language through interactive problems. The first few problems are easy enough that even someone with no prior experience should find the learning curve forgiving. See 'Help' for more information."

#### Ruby
* [Ruby Quiz](http://rubyquiz.com/) &mdash; "Ruby Quiz is a weekly programming challenge for Ruby programmers in the spirit of the Perl Quiz of the Week. A new Ruby Quiz is sent to the Ruby Talk mailing list each Friday."

#### Prolog
* [Prolog Problems](https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems) &mdash; "The purpose of this problem collection is to give you the opportunity to practice your skills in logic programming. Your goal should be to find the most elegant solution of the given problems. Efficiency is important, but logical clarity is even more crucial. Some of the (easy) problems can be trivially solved using built-in predicates. However, in these cases, you learn more if you try to find your own solution."

#### Perl
* [Perl Quiz](https://perl.plover.com/qotw/#archives) &mdash; Every Wednesday I send out a Perl quiz, usually a request to write a program or function to perform a certain task.
