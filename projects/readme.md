## Quick navigation:
**Practice**
+ [DS&A] - Data Structures and Algorithms practice problems and their solutions
+ [Project Euler] - series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems
+ [Other] - random programming problems

**Projects**
+ Projects mature enough not to be in sandbox but still too young for their own repository. Sparse documentation and tests

**Sandbox**
+ junkyard, unfinished projects. New projects reside here before maturing enough to go to project directory. 
Often no docs or tests.
