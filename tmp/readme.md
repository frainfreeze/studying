Evergrowing collection of programming projects and problem solutions. 
Comments, corrections and suggestions are more than welcome. 

## Quick navigation:
**Practice**
+ [DS&A] - Data Structures and Algorithms practice problems and their solutions
+ [Project Euler] - series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems
+ [Other] - random programming problems

**Projects**
+ [Sandbox] - junkyard, unfinished projects. New projects reside here before maturing enough to go one dir up. Often no docs or tests
+ projects mature enough not to be in sandbox but still too young for their own repository. Sparse documentation and tests

**Miscellaneous**
+ Collection of scripts and code snippets. See folders readme for details.
