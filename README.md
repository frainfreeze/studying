I'm currently studying Applied Software Engineering (B.Comp.Eng) at Algebra university. I'll be storing various school and private exercises & projects, materials from labs and such here at GitHub.

I'll also add stuff I did at home that has nothing to do with the university (autodidacticism ftw) as well, but this is mostly so that I don't have to use a many different repositories, and still utilize VCS, over the course of my studies.

Repository is divided in three main parts:  
- [/home](home) - stuff I learn and do in my free time that's unrelated to uni.
- [/projects](projects) - various smaller projects and scripts
- [/university](university) - stuff done at uni and related material
