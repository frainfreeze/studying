# studying

I'm currently studying Software Engineering (B.Comp.Eng) at Algebra university.
I'll be storing various school and private excercises & projects, some stuff from labs and such here at GitHub.

I'll also add stuff I did at home and stuff that has nothing to do with the school (self education ftw) as well, but this is mostly so that I don't have to use a gazillion different repos, and still utilize VCS, over the course of my studies.


[TOC levels=1-3]: # "#### Table of Contents"
#### Table of Contents
Repository is divided in three main parts,  

- [/university](#university) - stuff done at uni and uni related 
- /shared - subjects/fields of study that I do at uni but I also want to research further at home
- /home - stuff I learn and do in my free time that's unrelated to uni.

University (uni) courses have XXXXX number prefix.

### > 10003 Mathematics I, 10008 Mathematics II 

Literature:				

> Course handbook prepared and printed by Algebra University College				

The uni course aims:

> Adoption of the material provided for the curriculum , and it serves the achievement of knowledge and skills to work independently and also as a good preparation for the successful continuation of the study. Analyzing the real problems and create the appropriate mathematical model and critical review of the results obtained.

## > clojure

Clojure is a dynamic, general-purpose programming language, combining the approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming. Clojure is a compiled language, yet remains completely dynamic â€“ every feature supported by Clojure is supported at runtime. Clojure provides easy access to the Java frameworks, with optional type hints and type inference, to ensure that calls to Java can avoid reflection.

Clojure is a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data philosophy and a powerful macro system. Clojure is predominantly a functional programming language, and features a rich set of immutable, persistent data structures. When mutable state is needed, Clojure offers a software transactional memory system and reactive Agent system that ensure clean, correct, multithreaded designs.
