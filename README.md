This repository holds leftover materials and thesis from my time at highschool where I studied economics, secondary school exit exam materials, exercises & projects from Algebra university where I studied Applied Software Engineering (B.Comp.Eng) add stuff I do at home that has nothing to do with the university/work (autodidacticism ftw).

Repository is divided in two main parts:  
- [/home](home) - stuff I learn and do in my free time that's unrelated to my job.
- [/university](university) - stuff done at uni and related material
- [/matura](matura) - secondary school exit exam related materials
- [/highschool](highschool) - few things leftover from the highschool
