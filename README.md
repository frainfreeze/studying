# school-stuff
I'm currently studying Software Engineering (B.Comp.Eng) at Algebra university.
I'll be storing various school and private excercises & projects, some stuff from labs and such here at GitHub.

I'll also add stuff I did at home and stuff that has nothing to do with the school (self education ftw) as well, but this is mostly so that I don't have to use a gazillion different repos, and still utilize VCS, over the course of my studies.
