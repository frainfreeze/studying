I'm currently studying Applied Software Engineering (B.Comp.Eng) at Algebra university.
I'll be storing various school and private excercises & projects, some stuff from labs and such here at GitHub. University (uni) courses have XXXXX number prefix.

I'll also add stuff I did at home and stuff that has nothing to do with the school (self education ftw) as well, but this is mostly so that I don't have to use a gazillion different repos, and still utilize VCS, over the course of my studies.



Repository is divided in three main parts,  

- [/university](university) - stuff done at uni and uni related 
- [/shared](shared) - subjects/fields of study that I do at uni but I also want to research further at home (not directly related to CS)
- [/home](home) - stuff I learn and do in my free time that's unrelated to uni.
- [/practice](practice) - practice problems with solutions.
