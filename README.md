This repository holds materials, exercises & projects from my time at Algebra university where I studied Applied Software Engineering (B.Comp.Eng) add stuff I do at home that has nothing to do with the university/work (autodidacticism ftw).

Repository is divided in two main parts:  
- [/home](home) - stuff I learn and do in my free time that's unrelated to my job.
- [/university](university) - stuff done at uni and related material
