---------------------Software Engineering Roadmap------------------------

        I am adding and removing stuff __daily__, so to leave only
        "essential" and most helpful things. Consider this file an
        draft. While I am not sorry for "wasting" my time on "bad"
        courses and books, I wont list any of them here.
                  Resource hoarding is procrastination.
