========================================
Chapter 1: Fundamentals introduces a scientific and engineering basis for comparing algorithms and making predictions. It also includes our programming model.
Chapter 2: Sorting considers several classic sorting algorithms, including insertion sort, mergesort, and quicksort. It also features a binary heap implementation of a priority queue.
Chapter 3: Searching describes several classic symbol-table implementations, including binary search trees, redâ€“black trees, and hash tables.
Chapter 4: Graphs surveys the most important graph-processing problems, including depth-first search, breadth-first search, minimum spanning trees, and shortest paths.
Chapter 5: Strings investigates specialized algorithms for string processing, including radix sorting, substring search, tries, regular expressions, and data compression.
Chapter 6: Context highlights connections to systems programming, scientific computing, commercial applications, operations research, and intractability.
