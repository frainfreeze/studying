== Applied mathematics
=== Introductory Business Statistics
Introductory Business Statistics is designed to meet the scope and sequence 
requirements of the one-semester statistics course for business, economics, and 
related majors. Core statistical concepts and skills have been augmented with 
practical business examples, scenarios, and exercises. The result is a meaningful 
understanding of the discipline which will serve students in their business 
careers and real-world experiences.

==== Sampling and data
Since you will undoubtedly be given statistical information at some point in your life, you need to know some techniques
for analyzing the information thoughtfully. Think about buying a house or managing a budget. Think about your chosen
profession. The fields of economics, business, psychology, education, biology, law, computer science, police science, and
early childhood development require at least one course in statistics.

Included in this chapter are the basic ideas and words of probability and statistics. You will soon understand that statistics
and probability work together. You will also learn how data are gathered and what "good" data can be distinguished from
"bad."

===== Definitions of Statistics, Probability, and Key Terms
The science of statistics deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, 
and presentation of data. We see and use data in our everyday lives.

Organizing and summarizing data is called descriptive statistics. Two ways to 
summarize data are by graphing and by using numbers (for example, finding an average). 
After you have studied probability and probability distributions, you will use 
formal methods for drawing conclusions from "good" data. The formal methods are called
inferential statistics. Statistical inference uses probability to determine how confident
we can be that our conclusions are correct.

====== Probability
Probability is a mathematical tool used to study randomness.

====== Key Terms
In statistics, we generally want to study a population.

===== Data, Sampling, and Variation in Data and Sampling
Data may come from a population or from a sample.


=== Computational sciences
==== Numerical analysis
Many problems in mathematics cannot in general be solved exactly. 
Numerical analysis is the study of iterative methods and algorithms for 
approximately solving problems to a specified error bound. Includes 
numerical differentiation, numerical integration and numerical methods; 
c.f. scientific computing.

==== Computer algebra
This area is also called symbolic computation or algebraic computation. 
It deals with exact computation, for example with integers of arbitrary 
size, polynomials or elements of finite fields. It includes also the 
computation with non numeric mathematical objects like polynomial 
ideals or series.

=== Physical sciences
Mechanics, Mechanics of structures, Mechanics of deformable solids,
Fluid mechanics, Particle mechanics

=== Other applied mathematics

* Operations research (OR), also known as operational research, 
provides optimal or near-optimal solutions to complex problems. OR uses 
mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, and mathematical 
optimization.
* Mathematical programming (or mathematical optimization) minimizes (or 
maximizes) a real-valued function over a domain that is often specified 
by constraints on the variables. Mathematical programming studies these 
problems and develops iterative methods and algorithms for their 
solution.
