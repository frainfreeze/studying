== Applied mathematics
=== Probability and statistics

=== Computational sciences
==== Numerical analysis
Many problems in mathematics cannot in general be solved exactly. 
Numerical analysis is the study of iterative methods and algorithms for 
approximately solving problems to a specified error bound. Includes 
numerical differentiation, numerical integration and numerical methods; 
c.f. scientific computing.

==== Computer algebra
This area is also called symbolic computation or algebraic computation. 
It deals with exact computation, for example with integers of arbitrary 
size, polynomials or elements of finite fields. It includes also the 
computation with non numeric mathematical objects like polynomial 
ideals or series.

=== Physical sciences
Mechanics, Mechanics of structures, Mechanics of deformable solids,
Fluid mechanics, Particle mechanics

=== Other applied mathematics

* Operations research (OR), also known as operational research, 
provides optimal or near-optimal solutions to complex problems. OR uses 
mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, and mathematical 
optimization.
* Mathematical programming (or mathematical optimization) minimizes (or 
maximizes) a real-valued function over a domain that is often specified 
by constraints on the variables. Mathematical programming studies these 
problems and develops iterative methods and algorithms for their 
solution.
