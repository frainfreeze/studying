## Digital Systems Construction
Integrating key  topics  from  algorithms, computer 
architecture, operating  systems, compilers,  and  
software  engineering, in one unified framework.    
This will be done constructively, by building a 
general-purpose computer system from the ground up. 
Books:
- But how Do it Know? The Basic Principles of Computers for Everyone
- Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software

Result: [Atari 2600 emulator](https://github.com/frainfreeze/studying/tree/master/university/10011-CompArchitecture/atari-emulator-project#readme)
