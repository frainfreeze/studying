Evergrowing collection of programming projects and problem solutions. Comments, corrections and suggestions are more than welcome. 

For students and other people who found this repository by googling for answers: nobody likes a cheater and not only you will eventually get caught, but you won't learn anything by just copying so use my materials as reference only and make sure you at least understand what is being done.
