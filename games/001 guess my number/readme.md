# Guess My Number
The computer chooses a random number between 1 and 100, and
the player tries to guess the number in as few attempts as possible.
Each time the player enters a guess, the computer tells him whether the guess is too high,
too low, or right on the money. Once the player guesses the number, the game is
over and number of attempts is displayed.


Bonus: make computer guess number player picked!
