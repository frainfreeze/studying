### Intro
Why? I love the idea of working on lower level applications 
e.g. compilers, interpreters, parsers, virtual machines, etc.
So I decided to learn how to implement simple CPU/write VM as 
a way to introduce myself into the general realm of lower 
level programming! The 4001 is very simplistic processor, as 
it can only perform addition, and contains just four independent 
NOR gates, each with two inputs.
